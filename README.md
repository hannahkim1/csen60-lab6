What is the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs Lab 6?

The difference is that the website was being rendered in Lab 4 using client side rendering, which allowed the website to be rendered locally on the browser. While lab 6 is using server side rendering, which means the browser downloaded the js from the server in order to render the full website.
